    This algorithm solves 2 main problems: the first is finding the maximum clique through MCP (subgroup with the largest number of vertices)
    while the second is finding the maximum clique through weighted MWCP (each vertex has a weight).
    FastWClq_Algorithm: accepts Graph and cutoff - running time
